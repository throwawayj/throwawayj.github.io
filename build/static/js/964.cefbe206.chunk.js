Although this introductory position opened up new things to learn, I knew I wanted more. So I continued to learn as much as I could about I.T. and software development on the side. I pursued a degree in Information Technology and set my sights on becoming a systems administrator. After two years of helpdesk I was able to move up into a Jr. Systems Administrator position. I continued to learn as much as a could while at work, and on the side. Eventually learning how to script, I started automating my daily tasks. I found in scripting a passion for automation, which naturally led me to becoming a DevOps engineer. I enjoy breaking down tasks into small parts and finding ways to automate each step in a big task. This has led me to automate many things from daily tasks, deployments, and full CI/CD pipelines.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt Usana, I have learned much in the way of Javascript, Angular, and React to help develop in house applications used by our developers. These apps help facilitate the ease of deployments to environments and increase velocity. I have spent alot of time refining the C.I./C.D. pipeline. Specifically integrating automated testing post deployment to eventually reach a true C.I./C.D. Kubernetes has also been a huge focus of my job at Usana. Setting up automated deployments with helm charts to provisioning locally hosted Kubernetes Clusters.\n\n# Some history\n\n- I come from a Customer Service background at Key Bank, which transfers very well to my interactions as a DevOps Engineer and working with Development Teams\n- While attending school at W.G.U I also worked as a helpdesk engineer. This allowed me to put into practice what I was learning in school.\n- I gained my love of automation while being a Systems Engineer and being bored of clicking everything in a gui\n- I am a certified Salt Stack Engineer\n- Vim > Nano :)\n\n# I like\n\n- Learning\n- Reading\n- Gaming\n- Running (I try my hardest but have never been good at it)\n- Fall\n- Winter\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I was born and raised in Utah, and still live in Utah. I have lived in other states like Wyoming and Colorado\n- I have never left America :( but really hope to one day. Furthest I have travelled is to North Carolina\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- favorite books in no particular order:\n  - <u>A Christmas Carol</u>\n  - <u>Ender's Game</u>\n  - <u>The Name of the Wind</u>\n  - <u>To Kill a Mockingbird</u>\n  - <u>The Dark Forest</u>\n  - <u>The Book of Mormon</u>\n  - <u>The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson</u>\n  - <u>Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson</u>\n- Favorite Video Games\n  - Portal 2\n  - Final Fantasy IX\n  - Shovel Knight\n  - Donkey Kong Country\n  - Kirby's Dreamland\n  - Uncharted 2\n- I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints from 2001-2003 in Ventura, California (spent most my time in Bakersfield)\n\n# I dream of\n\n- Living in a seaside town like Ketchikan, Alaska\n",h=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,u=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,(0,t.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(r.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about James Gardner",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(s(),{source:d,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
