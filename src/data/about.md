# Intro

I started my career in I.T. as a helpdesk technician. Although this introductory position opened up new things to learn, I knew I wanted more. So I continued to learn as much as I could about I.T. and software development on the side. I pursued a degree in Information Technology and set my sights on becoming a systems administrator. After two years of helpdesk I was able to move up into a Jr. Systems Administrator position. I continued to learn as much as a could while at work, and on the side. Eventually learning how to script, I started automating my daily tasks. I found in scripting a passion for automation, which naturally led me to becoming a DevOps engineer. I enjoy breaking down tasks into small parts and finding ways to automate each step in a big task. This has led me to automate many things from daily tasks, deployments, and full CI/CD pipelines.

# Currently

At Usana, I have leanred much in the way of Javascript, Angular, and React to help develop in house applications used by our developers. These apps help facilitate the ease of deployments to environments and increase velocity. I have spent alot of time refining the C.I./C.D. pipeline. Specifically integrating automated testing post deployment to eventually reach a true C.I./C.D. Kubernetes has also been a huge focus of my job at Usana. Setting up automated deployments with helm charts to provisioning locally hosted Kubernetes Clusters.
